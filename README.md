# File Organizer and Tagging System

This program organizes files based on their types, provides a tagging system for file management, and allows easy searching of files by name or tag. It is designed to run on Windows and simplifies file organization and retrieval tasks.

## Features

1. **File Sorting by Type**:
   - Automatically organizes files in the "Files" folder by their extensions.
   - Creates new folders for each file type, named after the file extensions.
   - Provides options for optional or continuous naming.

2. **Tagging System**:
   - Allows users to assign up to 10 tags per file.
   - Tags are stored in a `tags.txt` file in an unencrypted format for future searches.
   - Provides an option to add, remove, or edit tags for files.

3. **File Search**:
   - Search files by name: Finds files without requiring the extension.
   - Search files by tag: Retrieves files based on their associated tags.
   - Both search methods transfer matched files to a "Search" folder.

4. **Editing System**:
   - Edit files name: Finds files and edits their name.
   - Edit tags: Modify, remove, or add new tags to files.

5. **Dynamic Folder Management**:
   - Ensures "Files" and "Search" folders are created at runtime if they donâ€™t exist.

6. **Seamless Return to Original Location**:
   - Files moved to the "Search" folder during a search are restored to their original locations upon completion.
